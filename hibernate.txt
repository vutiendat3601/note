Hibernate:
	- 

ORM (Object Relational Mapping):
	- Converting between data records in RDBMS and object in (object-oriented) programming language
	- ORM is a specification
	- There are various ORM implementations
	- Hibernate is the most popular ORM framework in Java

JPA (Java Persistence API):
	- One approach ORM
	- Can map, store, update and retrieve data from relational databases to Java objects and vice versa
	- Hibernate is one popular JPA implementation

Advantages:
	- Productivity
	- Maintainability
	- Portability
	- Database independent
	- Code generation tool
	- Advantages of OOP concepts
	- Caching mechanism
	- Connection Pooling
	- Lazy loading
	- Free cost effective

Disadvantages:
	- Slower than JDBC
	- Not suitable for batch processing
	- Lots of API to learn

Configuration:
	- Driver:
		+ In hibernate, using JDBC driver is a software component enabling a Java application to interact with a database
		+ Every database has its own driver class
		+ Every database driver needs to implement the Driver interface

	- Dialect:
		+ Means the variant of a language
		+ Each database has native SQL variations and SQL standard implementations
		+ Dialect class allows Hibernate to generate optimized and appropriate SQL statements for the chosen database

	- Account:
		+ User -> the login user name defined in the DBMS server
		+ Password -> the password for the login user

	- URL:
		+ In Hibernate, URL is JDBC url
		+ URLs could contain user and password

	- Show SQL:
		+ Write all SQL statements to console
		Used to display SQL generated in Hibernate (Development, Debug, Maintain, Error fixing)

	- hbm2ddl.auto:
		+ hibernate mapping to create schema DDL (Data Definition Language) -> work with schemas
		+ none (default value): do nothing
		+ validate: validate the schema, makes no changes to the database
		+ update: update the schema
		+ create: creates the schema, destroying previous data
		+ create-drop: drop the schema when the SessionFactory is closed explicitly, typically when the application is stopped

SessionFactory:
	- A class implement Factory Design Parttern
	- To create Session instances
	- Usually an application has a single SessionFactory object
	- Some methods:
		openSession(), close()
Session:
	- Session is an interface
	- The main runtime interfae between a Java application and Hibernate
	- Use for CRUD
	- The lifecycle of a Session is bounded by the beginning and end of a logical transaction
Create SessionFactory:
	- Hibernate 3.x:
		SessionFactory sf = new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory();
	- Hibernate 4.x:
		ServiceRegistry sr = new ServiceRegistryBuilder().applySettings(configuration.getProperties()).buildServiceRegistry();
		SessionFactory sf = configuration.buildSessionFactory(serviceRegistry);

Object state:
	- Transient
		+ Newly created objects (using constructors)
		+ Not associated with a Hibernate Session
		+ No persistent representation in the datbase

	- Persistent
		+ Has a representation in the database and an identifier value
		+ Be saved or loaded in the scope of a Session

	- Detached
		+ Objects that have been persistent, but its Session has been closed

Annotations:
	@Entity (class level) -> Required
		+ name: used in JPA queries
	@Table (class level) -> Optional
		+ name: created in the database

	PrimaryKey (Unique, not null, only one per table):
	@Id: Mark a column(s) as the primary key
	@GeneratedValue: auto increase attribute values
		+ strategy =GenerationType
		GenerationType:
			+ AUTO:
				default
				Hibernate will choose the generation strategy
			+ ENTITY:
				Generated values are unique only per type hierarchy
			+ SEQUENCE:
				Define a named sequence
				Used by one or more fields in one or more classes
			+ TABLE:
				Per table

	@Column
		+ name
		+ nullable
		+ length
		+ unique

	@Transient: only use the class var in Java, not map to database

	@Temporal: use to handle DateTime

	@Embedded, @Embeddable: use to add a composition class attributes

	@ElementCollection: use to store a collection in class attribute

Proxy Object:
	- Generated at runtime
	- Extends the original entity class
	- Delegates the call to the original entity to get normal attributes
	- To hide the lazy association initialization (For collection)

LazyLoading (ProxyObject): fetch when need
EagerLoading (ProxyObject): always fetch

One-To-One: 
	- A record in table A is associated with one and only one record in table B
	- One-To-One use foreign keys to join tables

One-To-Many:
	- A record in table A is associated with many records in table B. A record in table B is  associated with one record in table A
	-> A One-To-Many B & B Many-To-One A
	- Use join table to store the mapping value
	- Should consider roles of A and B to put the relationship marker

Many-To-Many:
	- a record in table A is associated with many records in table B
	- a record in table B is associated with many records in table A
	- Use join table to store the mapping values

HQL (Hibernate Query Language):
	- SQL operates on table and columns
	- HQL works with persistent objects and their properties
	- HQL queries are translated by Hibernate into conventional SQL queries
	- Advantage of Hibernate's SQL generation and caching strategies
