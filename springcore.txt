Spring Core:
	- The starting point
	- All Spring applications use core libraries and extensions

Constructor Drawback:
	- Hard code and High coupling (Dependence)
	- Complex APIs with long constructors
	-> IoC is solution

IoC (Inversion of Control):
	- IoC means that objects do not create other objects on which they rely to do their work
	- Instead, they get the objects that they need from an outside source
	- DI (Dependency Injection):
		+ is a form of IoC, where implementations  are passed into an object through constructors/setters/service lookups (namespace/configuration)
		+ IoC container is a specific kind of DI 
		+ DI is a specific kind of IoC
